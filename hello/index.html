<p>Those months were a frantic scramble. Designing the games themselves was trivial, but learning how the existing system worked and building the necessary engine for it to perform like a computer display proved to be a challenging process. It required a great deal of collaboration with <a href="http://www.brandywinerealty.com">Brandywine Reality Trust</a> every step of the way, for everything from frequent building access to fixing burnt out and incorrectly mapped LEDs. Thanks to both party's efforts, the necessary piping was completed just in time, leaving the crowd of spectators to kick off 2013's Philly Tech Week with Pong on the Cira Center's grand LED matrix "screen" from the historic Philadelphia Art Museum.</p>

<p>While organizing reference materials or studying, there are times we *really* want to emphasis a word or snippet, so much so that even __bolding__ the text won't suffice. For situations like this, <mark>highlighting is fully supported</mark> using the `==text to highlight==` syntax. For the highlight-lovers out there, multiple flavors like <mark class="red">Red</mark>, <mark class="orange">Orange</mark>, <mark class="yellow">Yellow</mark>, <mark class="blue">Blue</mark>, <mark class="green">Green</mark>, <mark class="purple">Purple</mark>, <mark class="pink">Pink</mark>, and <mark class="gray">Gray</mark> are supported.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you want your highlights to function as tags instead, just provide the additional `tag` class:</p>

<p>
<mark class="tag red">Red</mark> <mark class="tag orange">Orange</mark> <mark class="tag yellow">Yellow</mark> <mark class="tag blue">Blue</mark> <mark class="tag green">Green</mark> <mark class="tag purple">Purple</mark> <mark class="tag pink">Pink</mark> <mark class="tag gray">Gray</mark>
