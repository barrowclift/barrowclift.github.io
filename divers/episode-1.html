<dl>
<dt>Day 1</dt>
<dd>The party received intel late the previous night from their contact, Lucette, at the designated meeting place. First thing in the morning, they hitched a ride with Buck (a jaded coal caravan rider) northward and continued for the rest of the day. Slept on the caravan.</dd>
<dt>Day 2</dt>
<dd>The party noticed a house perched high on one of the nearby mountains and decided to hop off there to investigate. Before leaving, Niko inspired Buck to drop everything and pursue adventure and glory instead of continuing his soul-draining career. They then climbed the mountain, killed two goblins (Gooblen and Gibblen), and slept the night outside the mysterious house.</dd>
<dt>Day 3</dt>
<dd>Met with the house&rsquo;s sole resident, Finn. The party agreed to return at a later date with some raw materials and to pick up a prototype augment for Niko&rsquo;s arm. They then left and worked their way northward through The Reach towards where the Icicle Tusk Cave was marked on their maps. Slept just inside the four mile region where the cave was supposedly located. As they slept, four goblins passed in the middle of the night, noticed Cho, and began attacking the adventurers. The party managed to kill one, but the remaining three managed to down Chosei and Niko. Petra escaped, and with her cunning trickery she implanted the idea for the goblins to drag the two unconscious party members to their &ldquo;boss&rdquo; in Icicle Tusk Cave to offer as a fresh meal, ensuring her allies would remain alive for a bit longer. As it was deep into the night and the cave&rsquo;s path ahead was long, the goblins decided to rest outside the cave&rsquo;s entrance, where Petra (and the now stabilized and awakened Niko) jumped and slaughtered the remaining three goblins.</dd>
<dt>Day 4</dt>
<dd>As the sun began to rise, the party (still battered and bruised) headed back to their old camp and slept the majority of the day away. Headed back to the cave and began to enter as night fell.</dd>
<dt>Day 5</dt>
<dd>Explored the Icicle Tusk Cave (which they discovered was once called Druun), entered the vault, and obtained the scroll contents. They ended the day resting in the old storage room in the Druun ruins. We&rsquo;ll say this took enough time and they took enough rest to get their sleep schedule re-synced, and when they head out it will be the dawn of the 6th day.</dd>

<h2 id="unanswered-questions"><a name="user-content-unanswered-questions" href="#unanswered-questions" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Unanswered Questions</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Icicle Tusk Cave seems to have once been a place called Druun. While some details are clear (The settlement seemed to have heavily mined a mysterious mineral called cintamani to depletion), others are not (Why was there a recent, active bunker there? Whose bunker is it? Why is all of this connected to the supposed Arment family vault?)</li>
<li>Who is this Dwrcan Khurdak mentioned in the rotting tomes found in the Ruins of Druun? What&rsquo;s his connection to Huron Arment?</li>
<li>Who is the client? Why were they interested in the scroll&rsquo;s contents?</li>
<li>Something is&hellip; <em>off</em> about this mission. Either the thieves guild, Lucette, or the client are being lied to, telling lies, or purposefully concealing information.</li>
<li>Finn revealed he once lived in Drakkar and has a history with Darrak Khurdak, but became increasingly uncomfortable about revealing more. What&rsquo;s his story?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="items-obtained"><a name="user-content-items-obtained" href="#items-obtained" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Items Obtained</h2>
<ul>
<li>~140GP and a nice dozen or so of silver each</li>
<li>A fairly nice notebook, under Petra&rsquo;s possession</li>
<li>A smooth, egg-like carved cintamani stone, slightly larger than a clenched fist, under Niko&rsquo;s possession</li>
<li>A bag of cintamani (1 large &ldquo;fist sized&rdquo; stone, 3 medium, and 3 small), three small were used in dungeon</li>
<li>A small collection of cintamani carving and refining tools, under Petra&rsquo;s possession</li>
<li>A nice eyeglass inspection tool used for gem appraisal, under Petra&rsquo;s possession</li>
<li>5 bottles of <em>fine</em> wine from the Khurdak&rsquo;s bunker</li>
</ul>
<p>The cintamani (particularly the painstakingly carved egg-like stone) appear like they could fetch an incredible price, but by nature of them being special and practically one-of-a-kind in this day in age, it could prove difficult to sell to just anyone (at least for a worthwhile price).</p>
<p>Scroll contents:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dwrcan,</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been my dear friend these many years, and the memory of our last meeting still pains me, as I&rsquo;m sure it does you. However, my duty to my city and this land must take precedence, and I must urge you one final time not as a friend but as Lord of Ramon to reconsider your position. I beg you to not be tempted by the siren song and remember the recent fate of our Delma allies. We are entering strange and frightening times, and for something like that to suddenly appear is not only a bad omen but also a potential threat, and thus must be destroyed.</p>
<p>If I do not hear back from you within the week with plans to dispose of it together, I&rsquo;ll be forced to take matters into my own hands for the continued safety of Agora. I hope, should we meet along the way, its as allies, but I will do what I must should you continue to resist reason. I hope with all my heart it won&rsquo;t come to that.</p>
<p>Huron Arment</p>

<h2 id="people-met"><a name="user-content-people-met" href="#people-met" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>People Met</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Lucette (last name currently unknown)</dt>
<dd>&ldquo;The Guy&rdquo;&mdash;er, woman&mdash;that the group were told would be their contact for their mission briefing and who they&rsquo;d be delivering the copied scroll contents too. While she kept an air of coldness and snideness about her while initially conversing with the party, it appeared she warmed up enough to them near the end to response with a first name, upon Niko&rsquo;s request. As the party didn&rsquo;t insight this response, it&rsquo;s unclear if this is her true name.</dd>
<dt>Buck Vernon</dt>
<dd>An older, jaded dwarf driving the coal shipments from Drakkar to Ramon for more than half a century. The party (particularly Niko&rsquo;s handiwork) inspired him to drop everything, take his horse, and ride off on his own adventure. His last known location was somewhere deep in The Pale.</dd>
<dt>Finn A. Finnegan</dt>
<dd>An odd but pleasant old gnome tinkering away at experiments on the mountain. He is currently working on a &ldquo;mini-cannon&rdquo; arm augment for Niko in exchange for raw materials from the party. Upon questioning, he revealed he once lived in Drakkar and has a history with Darrak Khurdak, but the party politely decided to hold off asking more questions when they saw Finn getting increasingly uncomfortable with that line of questioning.</dd>
<dt>The Goblin Brothers Steve (formally Geblin) and Gibi</dt>
<dd>The last two remaining goblins in the Icicle Tusk Cave, who Petra cooly intimidated into surrendering. Niko suggested the goblin brothers seek out Finn to the south and reform their ways before knocking them both out. They were last seen knocked out in the cave after Niko drew &ldquo;BEWARE&rdquo; on their hands and tiny brains on their foreheads, and were gone when the party returned from the vault.</dd>
