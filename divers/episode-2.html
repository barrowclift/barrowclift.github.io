<dl>
<dt>Day 1</dt>
<dd>The party made it to the grimy Dwarven mining city of Drakkar on a quest to obtain materials requested by Finn. In exchange for these materials, Niko was promised a prototype &ldquo;mini-cannon&rdquo; arm augment upon their return. While obtaining the materials at the Trade Cavern, the party ran into Petra&rsquo;s grandmother, Jitka, and were all invited back to the family&rsquo;s home in the lower slums for food and shelter. When questioned about her sudden disappearance, Petra lied, claiming she was trapped in the mines and was saved by &ldquo;The Captain&rdquo; and his crew. Everyone in the large family (including Ludvik, who was the most upset at Petra&rsquo;s disappearance) seemed to believe her story. It was that night they also met the family fuck up, Radek, in &ldquo;The Mine&rdquo; tavern and managed to (mostly) diffuse the situation without conflict. Before leaving for the night, they had a brief talk with the sleepy Ale Drake, Snot, who provided some information to the party with regards to Finn&rsquo;s history in the city. In exchange for equally juicy secrets or <em>fine</em> drink/smoke, he&rsquo;s offered to answer additional questions should the party visit again.</dd>
<dt>Day 2</dt>
<dd>To retrieve the last good on Finn&rsquo;s list (oddly, 12 hummingbird feathers), the party visited &ldquo;Bits &lsquo;N Bops&rdquo; in the city&rsquo;s fancy, upper financial district. There they met an eccentric gnome, from whom they purchased a live hummingbird for Finn. Before the party left Drakkar, Petra gifted Ludvik with 20GP and was explicitly told to do with it as he pleased (whether that be on the family at home or as a jump start to finally leave the city as well, like he and Petra had talked about while growing up). With their final goodbyes said, the party went on their way. That night while sleeping on the road, Veryamorcion noticed a lone, spectral white wolf in the distance, seemingly watching the party. Soon after noticing the wolf, it trotted away and vanished.</dd>
<dt>Day 3</dt>
<dd>After a brief day&rsquo;s travel, the party made it back to Finn&rsquo;s mountain top home where they discovered the goblin brothers Steve and Gibi did indeed make it there and have been happily helping Finn with minor chores in exchange for food and &ldquo;weapons&rdquo; (really just knotty sticks). After dropping off the items, obtaining Niko&rsquo;s alpha mini-cannon augment, and loosening up Finn&rsquo;s timid nature with wine during dinner, the party learned of his former work in Drakkar and secret projects with Darrak (<a href="#revealed">mystery revealed ðŸŽ‰</a>). It was there they spent the night.</dd>
<dt>Day 4</dt>
<dd>The party journeyed south back to the crossroads. They kept to the road, and the day was mostly uneventful.</dd>
<dt>Day 5</dt>
<dd>They made it back to the crossroads where the mission first began ~14 days ago, and waited for nightfall to hand off the scroll to Lucette for their agreed payments. They all got 500GP, save for Niko, who got a special artifact as requested (an exquisite, mahogany box filled with 10 jade animal figurines, totaling roughly 500GP). After Lucette (horribly) made her smoke screen escape, the party decided to finish the night there at the crossroads, and decided to potentially travel to Ramon in the morning.</dd>

<ul>
<li>The Icicle Tusk Cave seems to have once been a place called Druun. While some details are clear (The settlement seemed to have heavily mined a mysterious mineral called cintamani to depletion), others are not (Why was there a recent, active bunker there? Whose bunker is it? Why is all of this connected to the supposed Arment family vault?)</li>
<li>Who is this Dwrcan Khurdak mentioned in the rotting tomes found in the Ruins of Druun? What&rsquo;s his connection to Huron Arment?</li>
<li>Who is the client? Why were they interested in the scroll&rsquo;s contents?</li>
<li>Something is&hellip; <em>off</em> about this mission. Either the thief&rsquo;s guild, Lucette, or the client are being lied to, telling lies, or purposefully concealing information.</li>
<li><mark class="green">Revealed</mark> <del>Finn revealed he once lived in Drakkar and has a history with Darrak Khurdak, but became increasingly uncomfortable about revealing more. What&rsquo;s his story?</del></li>
<li><mark>New</mark> What was that spectral white wolf that Veryamorcion noticed at his watch? Why was it spying on the party? Are they being followed?</li>
<li><mark>New</mark> What exactly is that stone Finn was studying under the careful eye of Darrak? Is it still there? Is it as dangerous as Finn fears?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="revealed"><a name="user-content-revealed" href="#revealed" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Revealed</h3>
<p>Finn grew up in Drakkar as the laughing stock of the city, having almost no real friends to speak of. This only accelerated his devotion to the study of the arcane and the sciences, all in an attempt to prove his worth to himself and the city residents. The fruits of his labor were eventually noticed by Darrak (of the Khurdak clan that runs Drakkar), who quickly hired him for secret projects. These projects involved the creation of the militaristic Automan, some minor defensive spells and systems for the clan cave, and the study of a massive heirloom stone deep in the Old Clan Mine that Darrak was <em>very</em> interested in harnessing as an power source. During the ~50 years there, Finn made incredible progress, but discovered the stone wasn&rsquo;t emanating this power from itself, but rather seemed to be necrotically leeching it from the surrounding environment, feeding it to somewhere else (a place Finn had difficulty describing, a &ldquo;Far Realm&rdquo; of sorts, and was clearly terrified of it). When he tried to warn the city of the threat and call them to action, Darrak publicly fired Finn, citing the gnome was going mad. Unable to take the humiliation, he fled the city.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Snot the Ale Drake</dt>
<dd>A lazy, trouble-causing Drake that&rsquo;s been &ldquo;passed down&rdquo; the family running &ldquo;The Mine&rdquo; Tavern for generations. The family seem to view him as both a blessing (in that a substantial amount of business is brought in by the trouble Snot tends to stir up) and a curse (for the trouble Snot tends to stir up). While at first blush he appears to be nothing more than a perpetually high &amp; drunk freeloader, he is constantly eavesdropping in on every conversation taking place at the tavern and seems to know far more than he&rsquo;s willing to give away for free. Due to Veryamorcion being his &ldquo;smoking partner&rdquo; for a spell at the end of Day 1, he freely offered the party some intel on Finn&rsquo;s history in the city. He made it clear that any &ldquo;juicy&rdquo; secrets he&rsquo;s heard would require an equally juicy secret or <em>fine</em> drink/smoke in exchange.</dd>
<dt>Eccentric gnome woman (Proprietor of Bits &lsquo;n Bops)</dt>
<dd>An odd but mostly kind gnome woman who runs the Bits &lsquo;N Bops shop in Drakkar&rsquo;s financial district. Seems to have an (ahem) intimate history of some sort with Finn. Whatever it was, it seems it did not end well.</dd>
<dt>The Kamenzdite Family</dt>
<dd>Too many to list here, see <a href="#the-kamenzdite-family-tree">The Kamenzdite Family Tree</a>.</dd>
<dt>Danny Bailey</dt>
<dd>Rude metal smith in the Trade Cavern. Totally not the name of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Bailey">famous professional footballer</a> picked in a panic. Nope, not at all.</dd>
