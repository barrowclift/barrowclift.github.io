<p>22/4/3880 - 23/4/3880</p>
<dl>
<dt>Day 1, 22/4/3880</dt>
<dd>Having just passed off the scroll contents to Lucette the prior night, the party spent the day traveling The Hard Road south towards Ramon and made camp beside the road in the farmlands scattered about the city outskirts. Late that night, Veryamorcion once again noticed a mysterious, spectral white wolf off in the distance, watching the party. Like last time, the wolf disappeared shortly after being noticed.</dd>
<dt>Day 2, 23/4/3880</dt>
<dd>The party entered the port city of Ramon and made quick work of scanning the community bulletin board there for things to do. After overhearing some guards passing by, they learned of the recent murder of a guard stationed in the Shipyards up north (of which they didn&rsquo;t seem to be incredibly concerned). Nonetheless, the party volunteered to assist the investigation with information, should they discover any while in town. Soon afterwards, Niko caught a strange pickpocket in the act&mdash;a young drow named Nera. Niko, after masterfully stopping Nera as she tried to slip away, offered the elf the tantalizing prospect of work and treasures in exchange for tagging along with the party and assisting in future jobs. Nera pouted, but agreed.<br><br />
After making their way to <em>Duffy&rsquo;s</em> (Niko&rsquo;s old haunt before he left the city about a month ago), they more or less confirmed the guard murder was in fact done by the young drow they had just picked up, and the party silently dropped the investigation (by all accounts, the particular guard was a horrible person and many seemed glad to be rid of him). They switched gears and instead spent the day with an investigation on the Shankill Butchers and their recent attacks&mdash;with some shopping at Market Street along the way.<br><br />
That night, the city was attacked! Two dozen or so Shankill Butchers broke past Ramon&rsquo;s southern gate into the city, with the clear intention of causing as much bloodshed and chaos as possible. The party just barely managed to kill eight of them as they were making their way northwest towards the Residential district as reinforcements from the Shipyard arrived to assist. Thanks to the party&rsquo;s efforts, Ramon&rsquo;s casualties were startlingly low at only seven (most of which were guards). The party received thanks from the guard Captain, who promised a reward, should the party visit him in the morning.<br><br />
Before resuming their interrupted rest from the busy day, the party agreed the Butchers would be their next target and prepared to set out northwards to Buck&rsquo;s static position on the map, fearing that he had perhaps been captured by them while in the wild (or even worse, that he had perhaps joined their ranks).</dd>

<ul>
<li><mark class="yellow">New</mark> What&rsquo;s going on with Bucky? Thank&rsquo;s to Petra&rsquo;s magic, the party know he&rsquo;s alive, but he&rsquo;s curiously remained stationary for the past few days (a stark change from his rapid movements from the previous pings).</li>
<li>What was that spectral white wolf that Veryamorcion noticed at his watch? Why was it spying on the party? Are they being followed?</li>
<li>What exactly is that stone Finn was studying under the careful eye of Darrak? Is it still there? Is it as dangerous as Finn fears?</li>
<li>The Icicle Tusk Cave seems to have once been a place called Druun. While some details are clear (The settlement seemed to have heavily mined a mysterious mineral called cintamani to depletion), others are not (Why was there a recent, active bunker there? Whose bunker is it? Why is all of this connected to the supposed Arment family vault?)</li>
<li>Who is this Dwrcan Khurdak mentioned in the rotting tomes found in the Ruins of Druun? What&rsquo;s his connection to Huron Arment?</li>
<li>Who is the client? Why were they interested in the scroll&rsquo;s contents?</li>
<li>Something is&hellip; <em>off</em> about this mission. Either the thief&rsquo;s guild, Lucette, or the client are being lied to, telling lies, or purposefully concealing information.</li>

<li>Bag of holding (Now in Petra&rsquo;s possession)</li>
<li>Alchemy Jug</li>

<dl>
<dt>Nera</dt>
<dd>A quiet, stubborn drow child whose pickpocketing attempts were foiled by Niko. Perhaps out of respect&mdash;or maybe simply the prospect of money from the promise of work&mdash;she&rsquo;s opted to tag along with the party.</dd>
<dt>Duffy</dt>
<dd>A kindly, simple man and proprietor of <em>Duffy&rsquo;s</em>, the go-to tavern for sailors, workmen, and guards in the northern Shipyard of Ramon.</dd>
<dt>Captain Sturgill</dt>
<dd>A ragged roustabout who can usually be found passed out at <em>Duffy&rsquo;s</em>. Upon hearing the party talking about their future ocean travel plans, he offered paid voyage to wherever they wished. Much to his dismay, the party expressed no interest in the offer.</dd>
<dt>Trader Joe</dt>
<dd>The sporadic, perhaps overly enthusiastic proprietor of <em>Trader Joe&rsquo;s</em>, the fierce competitor to <em>Retailer Pete&rsquo;s</em>.</dd>
<dt>Pete the Retailer</dt>
<dd>The soft spoken, sleep proprietor of <em>Retailer Pete&rsquo;s</em>, the fierce competitor of <em>Trader Joe&rsquo;s</em>.</dd>
