## Change Log

### January 15<sup>th</sup>, 2022

In the [Recommendations](/articles/fourth-annual-ios-music-player-showcase/19) section, reader Stephen Bowling wrote in to report both [Cs Music](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cs-music-player/id924491991)'s and [Musens](https://apps.apple.com/app/musens/id1560526260)' links were incorrectly pointing to other apps. Those apps' links now correctly point to their respective App Store listings.

### January 14<sup>th</sup>, 2022

In [Vinyl Fetish](/articles/fourth-annual-ios-music-player-showcase/18)'s section, [Germán](https://twitter.com/VinylFetishApp) (Vinyl Fetish's developer) wrote in to report a case where I accidentally referred to the app as [Vinyls](/articles/fourth-annual-ios-music-player-showcase/2#-vinyls). This slip of the keyboard has been corrected.

### January 12<sup>th</sup>, 2022

In [Doppler](/articles/fourth-annual-ios-music-player-showcase/9)'s section, [Ed](https://twitter.com/edwellbrook) (Doppler's developer) wrote in to correct my original claim that Doppler's "Import from Cloud Services" option only allowed importing individual files, when in reality multiple files *can* be imported at once (although arguably with some effort due to the Files.app interface). The paragraph in error has now been corrected.

### January 9<sup>th</sup>, 2022

In [Plum](/articles/fourth-annual-ios-music-player-showcase/16)'s section, I originally claimed there was no way to display the menu with a gesture. [Adam](https://twitter.com/adwienc) (Plum's developer) provided a correction in a [tweet](https://twitter.com/adwienc/status/1480167465992835076) that this is in fact possible; it requires a swipe-up gesture on the *left* side of the mini-player, the opposite side of where the menu icon resides. While I maintain this isn't particularly discoverable, I was completely wrong about the ability's existence and thus that paragraph has been corrected.

There were also a tremendous number of rather embarrassing spelling and grammatical errors in the original version that [Songpocket](https://songpocket.app)'s developer (H) thankfully pointed out for correction.
