## Change Log

### January 12th, 2022

In [Doppler](/post/fourth-annual-ios-music-player-showcase/9)'s section, I erroneously wrote that Doppler's "Import from Cloud Services" option only allowed importing individual files, when in reality multiple files *can* be imported at once (although arguably with some effort due to the Files.app interface). The appropriate section has been updated to reflect this.

### January 9th, 2022

In [Plum](/post/fourth-annual-ios-music-player-showcase/16)'s section, I originally claimed there was no way to display the menu with a gesture. [Adam](https://twitter.com/adwienc)—Plum's developer—provided a correction in a [tweet](https://twitter.com/adwienc/status/1480167465992835076) that this is in fact possible; it requires a swipe-up gesture on the *left* side of the mini-player, the opposite side of where the menu icon resides. While I maintain this isn't particularly discoverable, I was completely wrong about the ability's existence and thus that paragraph has been corrected.

There were also a tremendous number of rather embarrassing spelling and grammatical errors in the original version that [Songpocket](https://songpocket.app)'s developer (H) thankfully pointed out for correction.
