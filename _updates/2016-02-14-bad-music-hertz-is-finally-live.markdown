After talking about it for years my brother, Michael Barrowclift, and I launched our brand new music blog, [Bad Music Hertz](https://badmusichertz.com). We both cherish the record format and are excited to finally share our loved and not-so-loved listens. To celebrate the launch we have a double-feature: my brother's thoughts on [LUDO's Broken Bride](https://badmusichertz.com/post/broken-bride) and mine on [Fleet Fox's Helplessness Blues](https://badmusichertz.com/post/helplessness-blues). Stop on by and give us a spin.
