# Shoutouts

This website is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), hosted with [Github Pages](https://github.com/Barrowclift/barrowclift.github.io), and distributed by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

## Implementation

I am genuinely grateful for all the open source projects I used and advice I received from the community while building this website, including:

* **[Andreas Larsen](https://larsenwork.com/)**, whose [elegant "eased" gradients generator](https://larsenwork.com/easing-gradients/) was heavily used for many of the gradients throughout this site.
* **[BigFoot](http://www.bigfootjs.com/)** for their Instapaper-like footer popups used to power my article footnotes.
* **[Criag Hockenberry](https://furbo.org/2018/03/28/system-fonts-in-css/)** for trailblazing a backwards compatible `font-family` declaration which leverages the system's default typeface whenever possible, and which is used "as is" on this site.
* **[Gapless 5](https://github.com/regosen/Gapless-5)** for powering the [SMiLE: Heroes & Villains](http://localhost:4000/projects/music/smile-heroes-and-villains-mix/) page's jukebox.
* **[Hint](https://github.com/chinchang/hint.css)** for the lovely hover bubbles used throughout the site (like the [Projects](/projects) and [Social](/social) pages).
* **[jQuery](https://jquery.com)** powers lots of functionality on this site. Stuff what anyone else says: it was awesome, and quite frankly still *is* awesome.
* **[jQueryScript.net](http://www.jqueryscript.net/other/jQuery-Plugin-To-Add-Unique-Anchor-Links-To-Headlines-anchor-js.html)** whose anchor links script is leveraged to display header anchor links on hover.
* **[Michael J. Deeb](https://michaeljdeeb.com/)** for [his help](http://michaeljdeeb.com/blog/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/) getting a custom domain set up with Github Pages and Hover.
* **[Paul Lewis](https://developers.google.com/web/resources/contributors#paullewis)** & **[Robert Flack](https://developers.google.com/web/resources/contributors#flackr)**, authors of Google's [Performant Parallaxing developer article](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/12/performant-parallaxing) which was *heavily* referenced for my [Largest Video Game Ever](\/projects/code/the-largest-video-game-ever-made/) & [SMiLE: Heroes & Villains](http://localhost:4000/projects/music/smile-heroes-and-villains-mix/) pages.
* **[Richard Leland](https://github.com/richleland)** on Github for his [Pygments Monokai color scheme](https://github.com/richleland/pygments-css/blob/master/monokai.css), which I use for my syntax highlighting.
* **[shanidkv](http://www.shanidkv.com/blogs/shanidkv)** for publishing an [indispensable guide](http://www.shanidkv.com/blog/how-create-fixed-menu-when-scrolling-page) detailing how to implement a dynamically fixed menu (i.e. a menu that suddenly "floats" when scrolling).
* **[Typescale](http://type-scale.com)** for providing a brilliant little web app for the community to quickly and easily generate pleasing typography scales like the one used throughout this site.

## Inspiration

I drew inspiration for my website's design from many professionals, including:

* **[Bradley Taunt](https://bt.ht/)**, a web designer & developer hybrid like myself whose [original home page](https://web.archive.org/web/20200410050054/https://uglyduck.ca/) was the source of inspiration for [my own](/).
* **[Cezary Wojcik](http://cezarywojcik.com/)**, a self-proclaimed keyboard wizard and iOS Developer whose projects [gallery page](http://cezarywojcik.com/gallery) was the initial inspiration for [my own](/projects/).
* **[Christa Mrgan](https://www.antichrista.com/)**, whose work on [SixColors](https://sixcolors.com/about/) and tasteful eye for design helped guide my own design process throughout this site.
* **[Matt Birchler](https://birchtree.me)**, whose soft menu bar logo animation served the primary inspiration for my own, finally bringing the rainbow present on my site's bitmap logo images for years into the site itself.
* **[Silvia Gatta](https://web.archive.org/web/20160302134415/http://www.pixelcave.net/)**, the designer behind [MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/) and the primary driver motivating me to support dark mode, as well.
* **[Susan Kare](http://www.kare.com/portfolio/03_apple_macicons.html)**, the legendary graphic designer for the original Macintosh operating system, from whose work my ["Happy iMac" website logo](/images/share-banner.jpg) pays homage.

Above all else I thank my Mom and Dad, my older sister Aim√©e, my younger brother Michael, and my loving husband Khary for their continued support as I pursue my dreams. I love you all, thanks for everything.
