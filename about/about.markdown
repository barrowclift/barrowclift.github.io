My name is Marc Barrowclift, and I'm a full-stack developer with over {{ site.time | date: '%y' | minus: 14 }} years practical experience in the field.

Since the formative day my parents purchased our family's [first iMac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac_(Intel-based)#1st_generation:_Polycarbonate_iMac) back in 2006, I made it my life's mission to deliver a feeling of captivating magic in my work like I had felt upon booting up that iMac for the first time.

Upon arriving at [Drexel University](http://drexel.edu/) for my studies back in 2011, that passion began yielding results; from collaborating with my professors to create the Guinness World Record's ["Largest Video Game Display"](http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-architectural-videogame-display) at [2013's Philly Tech Week](https://knightfoundation.org/articles/philly-tech-week-and-pong/), to presenting the stylometry anonymization tool ["Anonymouth"](https://psal.cs.drexel.edu/index.php/Main_Page) at [2013's Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium](http://petools.soic.indiana.edu/), to finally completing my studies by helping my team land a coveted spot in 2016's senior design finals, I spent every day in my college education honing my craft.

In my professional career today, I continue delivering that same spark of joy in everything I do: from rock-solid backend services with understandable architecture and approachable documentation to visually captivating frontend designs, such as the site you're reading now.

When I'm not applying those principles to software or design, I pass the time [recording and editing the Bad Music Hertz podcast](https://badmusichertz.com/) with my brother, playing board games with friends at my weekly "Game Nights", or simply enjoying a good Old Fashioned while spinning a record.

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope one of my works here brightens your day.
