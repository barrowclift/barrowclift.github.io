Claiming other passionate creators shouldn't participate in design is harmful and short-sighted. Good design serves a deeper purpose than simply fulfilling its stated purpose; it's a key communication channel for telling your audience that you genuinely care about the quality of the work you're presenting. Creators have every reason to additionally leverage this tool for their craft, and that desire should not only be respected, but *encouraged* by others in the community.

This website's design, in addition to its writings and other creations therein, serve as a live demonstration of this point. All designers, even unofficial ones like me, have something special to share with the world.
