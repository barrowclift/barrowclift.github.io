A friend of mine once told me software engineers like myself shouldn't design.

I don't believe that.

Claiming other passionate creators shouldn't participate in design is harmful and short-sighted. Good design serves a deeper purpose than simply fulfilling its stated purpose; it serves as a key channel to communicate to your audience that you genuinely care about the quality of the work you're presenting. Creators have every reason to additionally leverage this communication channel for their craft, and that desire should not only be respected, but *encouraged* by others in the community.

This website's design, in addition to the writings and other creations within, serve as a live demonstration of this point. All designers, even unofficial ones like me, have something special to share with the world.
