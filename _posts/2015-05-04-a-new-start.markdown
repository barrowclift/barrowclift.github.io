A friend of mine once told me software engineers shouldn't do design.

I don't believe that.

Design is a powerful and important tool available to everyone. Making it out to be this exclusive club that software engineers, writers, and other creators can't and shouldn't participate in is harmful and short-sighted. Good design serves a deeper purpose than simply fulfilling its functional purpose (i.e. how it works). It serves as a key communication channel to express to your audience that you genuinely care about them and the quality of your work. Creators have every reason to want to communicate this care and respect to their audience and I believe that this desire should be respected.

This website, in addition sharing writings and other creations that celebrate the humanity in computing, will serve as a live demonstration of this point. All designers, even accidental ones like me, have something special to share with the world. Here's to the crazy ones, let's get started.
